# Project description:

Ficticial context of this project: a transportation service company is interested in invest in taxis , specifically in the yellow taxis of New York City (NYC).

This would be a new business unit and will be necessary make a preliminary analysis of taxis movement of NYC in order to make well-founded decisions.

# Objectives:
- Carry out a descriptive analysis of the yellow taxis operation in the five boroughs that make up the New York City during January 2018.

- Indetify the main producing and attracting areas of trip.

- Find relationships between meteorological variables and trip variables.


# What will we do as a Data Team?
Convert the raw data into information, and information into knowledge.

- Data preprocessing.
- A complete ETL process.
- Data analysis with Python.
- Manage a DataWarehouse in the Cloud.
- Manage a database in the Cloud to be able to carry out SQL queries.
- Make a PowerBi dashboard for Data visualization.
- Make a Machine Learning model.

## Raw Data -> Information -> Knowledge

- Data: Data Source.
- Information: raw data after a ETL process.
- Knowledge: KPIs, metrics, conclusions.


# Stages of the Project

This Project was organized by stages. The Stage 01 is explained in Stage01.md. Then, the next stages are in jupyter notebooks files in Data_Analysis_Python folder. They contain their respective codes with their respective explanation. Also, there is a folder called "ETL_process_dataware_connection_linux" that contain the python files which we used for do the automatization of download and upload of the data. Of course, this file do the ETL process and then upload the data into the DataWarehouse.

## Stage 01: Project design

- Set the objectives and the scope.
- Set KPIs.
- Determine what tech tools we will use.


## Stage 02: Exploratory analysis

- Carry out the basic operations of data exploration.
- Plot and visualization of the preprocessing data.

## Stage 03: Data cleaning and normalization

- Data normalization.
- Identify outliers, missing values, null values.
- Impute missing values or null values if it's necessary.
- Add features based on the original data for a better analysis.

## Stage 04: Data processing and visualization

- Data analytics in PowerBi
- Data visualization in PowerBi

## Stage 05: Machine Learning Model

- Make a machine learning model based on supervised learning algorithms for predict the total fare amount of a trip.
